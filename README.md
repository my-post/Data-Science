The dataset includes various information regarding diabetic and non-diabetic people. It lists various
symptoms associated with diabetes and also tells us about the age and gender of the person.
The Information makes it possible for the people within a certain age group and gender to change their
dietary plans and other lifestyle changes by predicting the risk of diabetes at an early stage.



1.) Importing libraries and dataset to be used to classify and preprocess the dataset Here we would
need numpy for the mathematical calculation of the working with dataset and matrices. Then we
would need pandas which have many inbuilt functions to help performing various kinds of slices
and selections. Matplotlib and seaborn will be used for visualizations and sklearn has important
libraries related to applying algorithms.

2.) Preprocessing the dataset will include checking for missing values, handling outliers, splitting
the dataset into training and test dataset.

3.) The categorical data needs to be converted to integer type to classify the dataset using label
encoder from the preprocessing library.

4.) After completing the preprocessing we analyze the dataset to gain inferences and use matplot
and seaborn library to visualize the data.

5.) We choose the algorithms to be used for classification as per our dataset and apply them using
the inbuilt libraries of python.

6.) We analyze our classification algorithm using the precision, recall, accuracy and f1 score of the
model and compare the different algorithms used according to their performance.
